# Page Replacement Algorithms

Three page replacement algorithms: First In First Out (FIFO), Least Recently Used (LRU) and Optimal Page replacement algorithms are implemented using C language. The results show that Optimal performs better than the two.

# Disk Scheduling Algorithms

Implemented and compared the results of three disk scheduling algorithms - FCFS, SCAN and C-SCAN - using C programming language.
